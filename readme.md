# Reproducing "MAUP"

I just want to reproduce some nice papers from CATMOG!

Robin Lovelace proposed the idea of RATMOG. 

The paper from Openshaw can be find here : https://github.com/qmrg/CATMOG/blob/Main/38-maup-openshaw.pdf

Iowa counties come from OpenStreetMap (OpenStreetMap contributors, 2022), dowloaded via overpass turbo with `query-raw_iowa.txt` and wrangled in `Iow_county.R`.

Population data come from National Historical GIS:  
Steven Manson, Jonathan Schroeder, David Van Riper, Tracy Kugler, and Steven Ruggles. IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information System: Version 17.0 [dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS. 2022.     http://doi.org/10.18128/D050.V17.0


`iowa_pop.R` record the step to convert it to something similar that Openshaw used.

I am still searching from election data.
